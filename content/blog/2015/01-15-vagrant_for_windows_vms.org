title: Vagrant for Windows VMs
---

I recently needed to build a Windows reference environment in order to provide
training on a system that was split across multiple servers in production. The
attendees were using both OS X and Windows, so I wanted to use Oracle VirtualBox
as a hypervisor rather than Hyper-V.

I was pretty happy with the results so I thought I'd write about it.

I started from scratch with a Windows Server 2008 R2 VM that I built directly in
VirtualBox. Once I had installed quite a bit of software (with a lot of help
from [[http://blogs.technet.com/b/jonjor/archive/2009/01/09/winrm-windows-remote-management-troubleshooting.aspx][Chocolatey]]) I packaged it up using Vagrant. As VirtualBox is Vagrant's
default provider this was as simple as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
vagrant package --base my-virtual-machine
#+END_EXAMPLE

I used a couple of helpful blog posts:

- [[http://www.hurryupandwait.io/blog/in-search-of-a-light-weight-windows-vagrant-box][one for reducing the size of the VM]] and
- [[http://blogs.technet.com/b/jonjor/archive/2009/01/09/winrm-windows-remote-management-troubleshooting.aspx][one to help with enabling Windows Remote Management on it]]

WinRM wasn't working until I ran:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
winrm quickconfig
#+END_EXAMPLE

By the end of this I had a single Windows Server Vagrant box that can be
provisioned on either Windows or OS X with only a couple of Vagrant commands:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
vagrant box add sandbox package.box
vagrant init
vagrant up
vagrant rdp
#+END_EXAMPLE

This all happens without opening VirtualBox which in my opinion is lacking in
the UI department. It's much better to just RDP to the server once it is
running.
