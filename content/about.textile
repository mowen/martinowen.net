h1. A Word of Introduction

I'm a software developer living in Liverpool in the United Kingdom. I work for "Qivox":http://www.qivox.co.uk/.

Some of the many things I'm interested in are:

* JavaScript/CoffeeScript
* C#/.NET
* Ruby
* MongoDB
* TDD/BDD
* Emacs (I can't bring myself to ditch it for Sublime Text)
* Lisp (particularly Clojure)
* Erlang
* Hardware Hacking (Arduino and Raspberry Pi)
